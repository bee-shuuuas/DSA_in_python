    "\n",
    "The name **\"bubble sort\"** comes from the way the **largest elements \"bubble up\" to the top (end) of the list** during each pass through the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's the logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine air bubbles in water — they naturally rise to the surface.\n",
    "- Similarly, in bubble sort:\n",
    "  - The largest unsorted value is compared and swapped forward until it reaches its correct position at the end of the array.\n",
    "  - On the next pass, the second-largest value \"bubbles up,\" and so on.\n",
    "- Each pass ensures the largest remaining unsorted element is moved to the rightmost unsorted position, like bubbles rising to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repeated movement of the largest unsorted element toward the end on each pass gives the algorithm its name.\n"
