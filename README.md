# Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my notes, code, and solutions while following the **Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises**. It includes detailed implementations of classic data structures, algorithms, and a number of practice problems inspired by **LeetCode**.
