# Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my notes, code, and solutions while following the **Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises**. It includes detailed implementations of classic data structures, algorithms, and a number of practice problems inspired by **LeetCode**.

## 🧠 Course Topics Covered

The course is organized into well-defined folders representing core data structure and algorithm topics: This course explains everything visually. 

| Folder                         | Description                                               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `04 - Linked Lists`           | Singly linked list operations, insertion, deletion, etc.  |
| `07 - Doubly Linked Lists`    | Doubly linked list with forward/backward traversal.       |
| `10 - Stacks & Queues`        | Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) implementation and use.     |
| `13 - Trees`                  | Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST).                  |
